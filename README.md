Project Description
A room with a mind of its own. Our system reminds forgetful humans (very politely) to turn off the lights when they leave a room ‚Äî because the room doesn't pay the electricity bill.
________________________________________
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People walk out of rooms leaving lights on, burning electricity and our patience. We're tired of yelling ‚ÄúSwitch off the light!‚Äù ‚Äî so we automated the nagging.
________________________________________
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using IR sensors and a DFPlayer Mini, our setup detects when someone leaves a room with the light still on ‚Äî and immediately plays a pre-recorded voice message (bonus if it's your mom‚Äôs voice) reminding you to go back and switch it off.

Screenshots

IR sensor detects someone entering the room

Speaker ready to play the message once the room is empty

Switch remains ON after everyone exits = A voice is played is played
